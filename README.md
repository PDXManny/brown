# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The sight of Uncle gives no pleasure,
   But rather causes much alarm:
The children know that at  his leisure
   He plans to have them come to harm.
